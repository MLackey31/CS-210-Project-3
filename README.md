Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-Project 3 is based around a Corner Grocer store that analyzes text input for their products
What did you do particularly well?
-I believe i really shined in this assignment with my proper documentation and efficient coding
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I am a firm believer in all coding could look nicer, there is never a "perfect" code so I wouldn't mind still cleaning it up some
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-Definitely coding it to be able to read an input file and also output to a new one, and I used some class provided reading to assist me as well as youtube and just practicing
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-I believe all the skills learned here can be used in any other class or job scenario, The code to read input/output can be used as a way to automate important emails and the class had quite a few assignments so a lot of time managment skills were learned
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-Documentation, The code has a very easy pattern to read and make changes too based around every point has proper documentation allowing it to be read very quickly
